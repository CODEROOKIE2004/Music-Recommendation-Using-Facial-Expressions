## Music-Recommendation-Using-Facial-Expressions

Please give us a ‚≠ê and fork this repo to get started. Thank you üôåüôå.

### Project Overview

This Python-based project leverages the power of OpenCV for facial recognition and a pre trained model (`fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5` model) for expressions recognition. By analyzing real-time facial expressions, it recommends music tailored to your current mood. To enhance the user experience, the project integrates YouTube search functionalities using the `webbrowser` and `requests` libraries.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SGCODEX/Music-Recommendation-Using-Facial-Expressions.git
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt --quiet
    ```
    
### How to Run

1.  **Execute the Script:**
    ```bash
    python main_face.py
    ```

### Tech Stack & Libraries

- Python: As the primary programming language for its versatility and extensive libraries.
- OpenCV: For real-time image and video processing, including facial detection.
- TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training the deep learning model to recognize facial expressions.
- fer2013_mini_XCEPTION.102-0.66.hdf5: A pre-trained model for facial emotion recognition.
- webbrowser: To open web pages, specifically YouTube search results.
- requests: For making HTTP requests to interact with web APIs (e.g., YouTube search).

### How it Works / Usage

1.  **Facial Detection:**
      - The script captures a video feed from your webcam.
      - OpenCV is used to detect faces in each frame.
2.  **Emotion Recognition:**
      - Detected faces are processed by the trained model.
      - The model predicts the dominant emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
      - Script captures the emotion when we click on the screen, the clicked emotion is stored as current emotion
3.  **Music Recommendation:**
      - Based on the predicted emotion, the script constructs a YouTube search query.
      - The `webbrowser` module opens the search results in your default browser.

### Main Features

### Customization & Additional Considerations

  - **Model:** Experiment with different pre-trained models or fine-tune the existing one for more accurate emotion recognition.
  - **Search Queries:** Adjust the search query construction to refine the music recommendations.
  - **User Interface:** Consider creating a user-friendly GUI / Front end to enhance the experience.
  - **Privacy:** Be mindful of privacy concerns when capturing and processing facial data.
  - **Performance:** Optimize the code for real-time performance, especially on resource-constrained devices.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions.
